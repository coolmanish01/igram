    <p>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
      whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.
    </p>
    <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
    <h2 class="py-6 text-3xl">Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
      suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
      limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything
      through the Service.
    </p>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable
      for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
      damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal
      injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service,
      third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any
      provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
    </p>
    <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
      consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
      party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <h2 class="py-6 text-3xl">"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and
      defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on
      its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
      expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, with respect to the
      Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and
      non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or
      trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking and
      makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended
      results, be compatible or work with any other
      software, applications, systems, or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or
      reliability standards, or be error-free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.
    </p>
    <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
      representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the

      be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or

      from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs, or
      other harmful components.
    </p>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
      statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
      But in such a case, the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest
      extent enforceable under applicable law.
    </p>

      law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
    </p>
    <h3>Waiver</h3>
    <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
      this Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
      thereafter, nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
    </p>
    <h2 class="py-6 text-3xl">Translation Interpretation</h2>
